This app is designed for rock climbers who are interested in finding new bouldering routes to tackle. It allows users to set a location on a map and mark the location of boulders that are available for climbing. The app also provides information about the difficulty of each route, how many people have successfully completed the route, and the rating given to the route by other users. All of this data is generated by users of the app, which allows for a diverse range of routes to be available for climbers to choose from. Whether you're an experienced climber looking for a new challenge or a beginner looking to try out the sport, this app is a great resource for finding and exploring new bouldering routes.
